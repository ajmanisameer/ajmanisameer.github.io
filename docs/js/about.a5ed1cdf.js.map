I'm interested in a lot of things, but specially tech,\n          truth, improving myself and improving the world. One of my life’s\n          goals is self-actualization, and I’m on the mission to show as many\n          people as I can that they can realize their potential, too.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I taught myself how to write code and building websites to help people\n          become better at what they do.
