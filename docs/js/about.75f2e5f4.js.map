I'm interested in a lot of things, but specially tech,\n          truth, improving myself and improving the world. One of my life’s\n          goals is self-actualization, and I’m on the mission to show as many\n          people as I can that they can realize their potential, too.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I taught myself how to write code and building webistes to help people\n          become better at what they do. I am currently a software\n          engineer(self-taught) building a enterprise grade SaaS application.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <h1 class=\"mt-10 text-4xl\">About my blog</h1>\n      <div class=\"content text-xl mt-6\">\n        <p>\n          This blog is a collection of my thoughts on various ideas I've found\n          valuable for being happy, improving my life, or understanding the\n          world.
