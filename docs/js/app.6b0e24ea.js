To achieve a goal, this breaks down into two parts: figure out what needs to be done, and actually do it. </br></br> As stated, this sounds completely trivial. But I think there is a really important and non-obvious point here. Some part of me is convinced that the main bottleneck for achieving my goals is being smart, coming up with the best plan, getting all of the necessary information. And this is true! It doesn\'t matter how good you are at doing things, if what you\'re doing is crap. But it also doesn\'t matter how good my plan is if I never act upon it. </br></br>And it\'s really easy to miss this point. It\'s easy to always think \\"I can do this tomorrow\\" or \\"this is not a priority\\" or \\"this would never work\\". And it\'s hard, because sometimes those thoughts are correct. But I find, unless I put in active effort, I\'m the kind of person who\'ll always have those thoughts. I\'ll never actually act upon my goals, change things about my life. </br></br>One of the main symptoms of this is that I\'m always aware of my problems in life, and will often aware of them for a very long. I\'ll notice that I don\'t exercise enough, that I\'m not enjoying the courses I\'m studying, that I really dislike being single, that I dont have enough time to do what I find most fulfilling and that I am a total wasteman. But there wont be a connection in my mind from \\"this is a problem\\" to  \\"what am I going to do about it\\". It\'s not that I think through the problem, and conclude that I can\'t do anything, it never feels like there\'s a question to be asked in the first place! And I think this is a problem that extends beyond me - I notice some amount of this in most of my friends, and I think it\'s inceredibly widespread. There seems to be a mental block between \\"things are not as I want them to be\\" and \\"I can actually to something about it\\" </br></br> I\'m writing this post not to complain about how much it sucks, it\'s because I think this is a solvable problem. Being the kind of person who does things, an agent, is a skill, and I think it is a trainable skill. And this is hard, and won\'t work perfectly, but there\'s a lot of room for progress. And this is one of the most valuable skills I\'ve ever tried developing. </br></br>The main symptom is that, in the movement, acting upon your desire never feels urgent. It never feels important and can be put off. Or it never feels possible, the problem just feels like a fact of life. And so the solution must center on solving the problem in the movement. And the solution that worked for me, is to make it part of your identity to be an agent. Make it a point of principle to do things, not because the thing is necessarily the perfect action, but because I choose the life where I do things, over the life where I always wait for the perfect opportunity. </br></br>Notice the small problem, and fix them. Notice when the jug of water is empty, and be the one to fill it. Notice when you say \\"oh, I can do this tomorrow\\" and do it today. Notice when you think \\"I should get round to this sometime\\" and actually do it. Notice when something is inefficient, notice the thing nobody is doing, and be the person who does it! </br></br> It doesn\'t matter if I\'m not doing the right thing, because what I\'m doing is not that important. I can close off the paralysing thoughts, not by answering them on their own terms, but by realising that the choice I make today affects the kind of person I\'ll be for the rest of my life. And that that\'s far more important than whatever trivial bullshit is going on in my life today. And thus I train the habit of actually doing things.  </br></br>And it doesn\'t even matter if I do make the wrong and imperfect choices in all of the day-to-day mundanity. What matters is that, when that one golden opportunity comes along, I am that kind of person who will take it. A thousand tiny losses are nothing against the big win that really counts. </br></br>If there\'s one thing you take from this post, let it be this: notice the next time you worry over a choice, or pass up an opportunity. And ask yourself not \\"what is the right decision\\" but rather \\"which decision will get me closer to the kind of person I want to be\\"."},{"id":3,"date":"20-09-2021","title":"On expanding scope","description":"I reflected recently about the moments where I felt the happiest.
