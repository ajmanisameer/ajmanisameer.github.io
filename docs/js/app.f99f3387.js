Territory","description":"One of the important concept I\'ve recently internalized is the phrase \\"The map is not the territory\\". The map refers to my mind and my internal experiences: my beliefs, my intuitions, my feelings, my memories, my sensory experiences. And the territory refers to objective reality, the world outside me. \\"The which, when you stop believing in it, dosen\'t goes away.\\"  </br> </br> Obviously reality exists outside of my head, and my perception aren\'t perfectly accurate. The part that feels key to me is the part that I only have the map. Objective reality exists outside of my head, but I can only see my internal experiences. But everything I care about lives in the territory. So, my goal is to infer what I can about the territory from my map. And the map does not automatically correspond to the territory, so this takes careful thoughts and effort. </br> </br> And the key difficulty is that, from the inside, it feels like map is the territory. My beliefs don\'t have labels attached saying which ones are biased and which ones are not, they all just feels like truth. If I care about finding the objective truth, I need to train the skill of looking past this, and trying as hard as I can to understand the true territory.  </br> </br> Often it feels like I have a clear view of the territory, when really I\'m looking at it through the flawed lens of my biases and assumptions - a map with lot of scribbles on it. Intuitions and assumptions can be important, and can contain a lot of information, but this is not automatic. It\'s something that needs care and attention. </br> </br> A few common trends are that my map is systematically bad at tracking some important things: abstract ideas, like opportunity cost and the value of information; creative ideas I haven\'t thought of yet; overweighting risks and underweighting rewards; uncertainty about my beliefs.</br> </br> One of the key feature of my map is my emotion, and what I feel. Noticing \\"this makes me happy\\" is valuable information, because \\"I am happy\\" is a fact about the map and the territory. My mind lives in the real world, and I care about what happens inside of it. But even here, it\'s important to distinguish this. When choosing a career, I care about what will make me happy in the long term, a question of the territory. While the map substitutes this for the question \\"what feels like it\'ll make me happy?\\" </br> </br> On a more practical level, I sometimes find challenging my beliefs, and trying to figure out why is it wrong very useful when processing emotions, especially insecurities. From the inside, an insecurity is a niggling voice of doubt at the back of my mind. Always thinking the worst - do people dislike me? Is this good enough? Should I stop doing this? Am I being weird? And from this initial seed of doubt, it\'s easy to start on a spiral of paralyzing insecurity and self-doubt, from which it\'s hard to escape.</br> </br>  The standard thing to try is to ignore this, by applying willpower and distracting myself. But this works badly on me, because it could be true. I can\'t make myself believe a lie by sheer force of will. But insecurities live in the map, while the doubt is about a question of reality, of the territory. Insecurity is a systematic flaw in my map - seeing the worst, a lack of calibration. And so to overcome it I find something stronger, and seek something better connected to reality. Because the impulse to notice flaws and question myself is one I respect, and will not remove from myself. And part of me will rebel if I try to ignore it with force of will. But all of me can align behind finding the truth.</br> </br> The map is not the territory. And everything I care about lives in the territory. But all I have is the map, and from the inside it feels like the territory. And I need to always be careful to keep track of the difference."},{"id":10,"date":"01-01-2022","title":"Amor Fati - love your fate","description":"  <span class= \\"font-bold\\"> ,,My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, nor forward, not backward, not in all eternity.

To achieve a goal, this breaks down into two parts: figure out what needs to be done, and actually do it. </br></br> As stated, this sounds completely trivial. But I think there is a really important and non-obvious point here. Some part of me is convinced that the main bottleneck for achieving my goals is being smart, coming up with the best plan, getting all of the necessary information. And this is true! It doesn\'t matter how good you are at doing things, if what you\'re doing is crap. But it also doesn\'t matter how good my plan is if I never act upon it. </br></br>And it\'s really easy to miss this point. It\'s easy to always think \\"I can do this tomorrow\\" or \\"this is not a priority\\" or \\"this would never work\\". And it\'s hard, because sometimes those thoughts are correct. But I find, unless I put in active effort, I\'m the kind of person who\'ll always have those thoughts. I\'ll never actually act upon my goals, change things about my life. </br></br>One of the main symptoms of this is that I\'m always aware of my problems in life, and will often aware of them for a very long. I\'ll notice that I don\'t exercise enough, that I\'m not enjoying the courses I\'m studying, that I really dislike being single, that I dont have enough time to do what I find most fulfilling and that I am a total wasteman. But there wont be a connection in my mind from \\"this is a problem\\" to  \\"what am I going to do about it\\". It\'s not that I think through the problem, and conclude that I can\'t do anything, it never feels like there\'s a question to be asked in the first place! And I think this is a problem that extends beyond me - I notice some amount of this in most of my friends, and I think it\'s inceredibly widespread. There seems to be a mental block between \\"things are not as I want them to be\\" and \\"I can actually to something about it\\" </br></br> I\'m writing this post not to complain about how much it sucks, it\'s because I think this is a solvable problem. Being the kind of person who does things, an agent, is a skill, and I think it is a trainable skill. And this is hard, and won\'t work perfectly, but there\'s a lot of room for progress. And this is one of the most valuable skills I\'ve ever tried developing. </br></br>The main symptom is that, in the movement, acting upon your desire never feels urgent. It never feels important and can be put off. Or it never feels possible, the problem just feels like a fact of life. And so the solution must center on solving the problem in the movement. And the solution that worked for me, is to make it part of your identity to be an agent. Make it a point of principle to do things, not because the thing is necessarily the perfect action, but because I choose the life where I do things, over the life where I always wait for the perfect opportunity. </br></br>Notice the small problem, and fix them. Notice when the jug of water is empty, and be the one to fill it. Notice when you say \\"oh, I can do this tomorrow\\" and do it today. Notice when you think \\"I should get round to this sometime\\" and actually do it. Notice when something is inefficient, notice the thing nobody is doing, and be the person who does it! </br></br> It doesn\'t matter if I\'m not doing the right thing, because what I\'m doing is not that important. I can close off the paralysing thoughts, not by answering them on their own terms, but by realising that the choice I make today affects the kind of person I\'ll be for the rest of my life. And that that\'s far more important than whatever trivial bullshit is going on in my life today. And thus I train the habit of actually doing things.  </br></br>And it doesn\'t even matter if I do make the wrong and imperfect choices in all of the day-to-day mundanity. What matters is that, when that one golden opportunity comes along, I am that kind of person who will take it. A thousand tiny losses are nothing against the big win that really counts. </br></br>If there\'s one thing you take from this post, let it be this: notice the next time you worry over a choice, or pass up an opportunity. And ask yourself not \\"what is the right decision\\" but rather \\"which decision will get me closer to the kind of person I want to be\\"."},{"id":3,"date":"20-09-2021","title":"On expanding scope","description":"I reflected recently about the moments where I felt the happiest.
