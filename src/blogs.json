    "description": "Many people want to be successful in business. Many people want to be excellent coders. Many people want to have a great relationship. When I look at those that are the best in their crafts, it is not their desire that sets them apart from the crowd. It is their clear understanding of what it takes, and their resolve to do what it takes. </br> </br> What to be great in business? Prepare to be doubted by many. Want to be an excellent engineer, prepare to face the limits of your knowledge, prepare to sound dumb many times over. Want to be great at relationship, prepare to face rejections."

    "description": "I reflected recently about the moments where I felt the happiest. The moments where I saw the largest gain, or experienced person growth. During these moments, the one constant was that I was thinking about something greater than myself â€” family, team, friends. </br> </br> Then I thought of the moments where I was the closest to causing irreparable damage. In these moments the constant was that I was internally focused, worried about myself, anxious."
